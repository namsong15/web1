  <h1>HTML 문서 만들기</h1>

  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/" title="웹페이지 링크">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language
  for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.</p>
  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
  storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
  the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
  for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building
  blocks of HTML pages.

  <p>With HTML constructs, images and other objects,
  such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.
  It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
  semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
  other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
